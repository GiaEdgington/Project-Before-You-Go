# Before You Go

This app allows users to pick a trip destination and returns location-based book recommendations, enhancing awareness of the areaâ€™s culture and history prior to or during travel.

## How It's Built

- Developed Rails RESTful API back-end to store data for users, books and destinations.

- Implemented authentication using JSON Web Tokens and localStorage to store encrypted user information.
Built front-end user interface using React to provide user experience for search and selection of books based on destinations.

- Leveraged Wikipedia API to locate book titles based on location setting and Google Books API to retrieve detailed information for titles provided by Wikipedia.

- Created custom CSS to style application.
